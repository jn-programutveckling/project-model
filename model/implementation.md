# Introduction

With our [project plan](project-plan.md) in hand it's time for us to create an implementation that satisfies the project goals and requirements. This in a highly iterative process; not only within this phase but also involving revising the project plan.

The basis upon which we plan the implementation is the activity list in the project plan. In this document I describe the stages activities and milestones go through.

# Write tests

Before we start blasting away coding we should think about how we can test the implementation of the activity. Unit tests are the most straight-forward, but other types of tests are also useful. At the start, all unit tests will obviously fail, but that is expected. Once we start writing code we should regularly run these tests to see whether they pass or fail. As long as they are failing we know we're not done with the implementation.
