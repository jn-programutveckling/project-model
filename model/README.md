# Introduction

Project management is hard. Although I have taken university courses in project management and worked in the software development industry for a long time, structuring my own work as a sole developer has proved to be difficult. 

Most literature is aimed at groups of people, which makes sense because the more people working together, the bigger the need for a methodical approach to how the work should be performed. One would think that when working alone, and especially for oneself on one's own projects, there is no need for a formalised project model. I guess some people can handle working in such an ad-hoc fashion, but I'm not like that.

Of course, many of the documents and processes needed for managing a large project involving perhaps hundreds of people over several years are completely irrelevant for one-person team projects. This is where this project model comes in.

Modern software development favours agile and scrum over waterfall, due to the high demand of quick adaptations and iterative development modern software have. I've worked with agile project workflows and they are very good when working in teams, because of the collaborative nature of that methodology. However, I have found that when trying to use the same workflow I'm used to when working with other developers when working alone on my own projects (and without real deadlines), agile and scrum doesn't work as well.

In this project model I make use of both the older waterfall methodology and agile where it makes sense to use either.

# Project lifecycle in short

In short, a project lifecycle can be described in the following list.

1. Define the project.
2. Perform initial planning at a high level.
3. While the project isn't finishedâ€¦
   1. Perform more detailed planning for the next high-level milestone.
   2. Implement everything planned in the previous step.
   3. Evaluate that the implementation satisfies what is planned.
   4. Prepare and release appropriate deliveries according to the initial planning.
4. Evaluate that the implementation satisfies the overall planning.
5. Prepare and release the final deliveries according to the initial planning.

What I call *initial planning* here mustn't be interpreted as the first draft or any other such static planning document. The initial planning can and should change throughout the project.
