# Open source or closed source?

The first thing we probably should be thinking about is whether the project should be open or closed source. There are pros and cons with either choice.

Open-source software builds trust because users can inspect the code for themselves. It's also easier for users to file good bug reports and also contribute with fixes themselves. The major downside of open-source software is that it's much harder to make money on it, because users could just download the source and build the software themselves instead of buying it from us. Developers of commercial open-source software usually solve this problem by having two versions, one free and open-source and one paid and closed-source, where the paid version offers more features and also support.

It's always easier to turn a closed-source project into an open-source one than the other way around. My recommendation is to always start out with closed source if there is no compelling reason to do otherwise, for example use of third-party libraries which licenses require us to have our code open-source (for example the [GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)).
