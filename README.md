# Project Model

The project model I use for both professional and hobby software development. I also use it for other type of projects.

## Usage

To use this project model, start with downloading or cloning this repository. You can also read it online on GitHub. The starting point for the project model itself is the file *model/README.md*. From there, there are more specific documents in the *model* directory to read depending on what you're interested in.
